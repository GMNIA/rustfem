# rustfem
Rust repository for fem structures made in rust. The project develops APIs connecting backend numerical engine and frontend 3d geometry / properties input.
The APIs convey complex 3d geometric data visualised in any CAD format into low-level information for the numerical simulation with finite elements.
Python binds and CAE binds are planned for API usage.
